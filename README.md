# ISLR-exercises  
A collection of Python notebooks containing my attempts to solve some exercise questions of ['An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R'](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) written by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).

The required data files were obtained from the excellent [ISLR-Python](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python) repository.
