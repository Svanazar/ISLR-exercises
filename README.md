# ISLR-exercises  
A collection of Python notebooks containing my attempts to solve some exercise questions of ['An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R'](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) written by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).

The required data files were obtained from these repositories:  
- [ISLR-python](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python)
- [ISL-python](https://github.com/a-martyn/ISL-python)
